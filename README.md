splat
======

Splat is a CHIP-8 emulator.
For more information about CHIP-8, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8

####Compiling and running the code:

`$ g++ stateData.cpp opcodeProcessing.cpp main.cpp -o SPLAT -Wall -lm -O2 -L/usr/X11R6/lib -std=c++11 -pthread -lX11`

`$ ./SPLAT path_to_CHIP-8_ROM_file > output.txt  # Redirect the output to a text file so you don't have to see it while running the program. Also, path_to_CHIP-8_ROM_file can be relative from the current directory, or absolute.`

*End program using **Ctrl+c or Ctrl+z***


####Controls:

The keyboard is mapped as follows...

##### CHIP-8 ----> Normal Keyboard 
```
[1][2][3][C]     [4][5][6][7]
[4][5][6][D] --> [R][T][Y][U]
[7][8][9][E]     [F][G][H][J]
[A][0][B][F]     [V][B][N][M]
```
The controls vary for each ROM, so experiment with the controls.

####Background

This project was created out of a desire to learn more about emulation. After doing some research, it was discovered that one of the easiest things to emulate is CHIP-8. So, we began this project. Note that all CHIP-8 ROMs are public domain, and can be found by simple Google queries.
